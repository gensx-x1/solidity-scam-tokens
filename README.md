# Solidity Scam Tokens

This repository collects examples of scam tokens written in Solidity, showcasing deceptive patterns and vulnerabilities commonly found in the wild. The primary goal is to raise awareness, aid security research, and help developers recognize fraudulent practices in blockchain applications.

> **Note:** This project is strictly for learning and research, not for exploiting these techniques in practice.

## Purpose

I created this repository to help people avoid falling for scams by understanding how deceptive tokens are designed. By examining real-world examples, users can better recognize and avoid malicious patterns in blockchain contracts.

## Usage

All contracts in this repository will include a README file with a detailed explanation of the scam technique involved, along with comments in the source code for further clarification. This setup aims to make each example accessible and easy to understand for both developers and non-developers alike.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes only. **Do not deploy these contracts to any network except for testnet and private networks.**
